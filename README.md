### Hi, this is Ali ðŸ‘‹
I am working as Data and Behavioral Scientist at CEB, United Nations. 
I am a behavioral and experimental economist by training. 

For my research, I use methods from data science, machine learning, microeconomics, game theory,
behavioral and experimental economics, agent-based modeling.

I am also interested in software development related to experimental
social sciences and data analysis.

Some tools that I made or contributed to
----------------------------------------

-   **[zBrac](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/zbrac/)**: a tool for the well-known behavioral experiment software [z-Tree](https://www.ztree.uzh.ch/en.html), which helps you conduct multilanguage experiments. We built it with Python and Qt5, **together with Anna Schroeter**.

-  **[choicepy](https://github.com/aseyq/choicepy)**: A python package for a social choice theory simulations tool for Python. It has very few features yet. Made together with **Annika Hennes**. We also used it for our research paper \"*Wisdom of crowds and voting*.\"

-   **[matchgreek](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/matchgreek/)**: A tool for LaTeX that tells you which greek symbols you already used and which are still available.

-   **[flyCSV](https://github.com/aseyq/flyCSV)**: This tiny R package allows you to look at your data frames as CSV files on the fly.

-   **[Qualtrics IBAN Checker](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/qualtrics-iban-check):** Qualtrics adaptation of a simple JavaScript IBAN validator.

Some courses/documentations with public repositories
----------------------------------------------------

-   **[oTree Community Book (currently oTre version 3)](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/otree-course)**: This is an open-documentation project I am planning for the behavioral experiment software [oTree](https://github.com/oTree-org/oTree). At the moment repository contains my notes of the oTree course that I have given at the Max Planck Institute.

-   **[oTree Crash Course](https://github.com/aseyq/cereb-otree)**: Materials from the workshop I gave at CEREB, Erfurt. oTree versions 5+

-   **[Games and Agents - An introduction to ABM using Python](https://github.com/aseyq/leidensim)**: Materials from the workshop I gave at Leiden University.

-   **[Introduction to R for Mathematics](https://github.com/aseyq/trentomathr)**: This is the repository of the crash course I gave on R as a part of the mathematics course at the University of Trento.

-   **[Introduction to ggplot2](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/jdmx-ggplot2)**: This is the repository for 3 hours workshop on ggplot that I gave at the Judgment and Decision Making (JDMx) Workshop in 2019.
