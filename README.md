### Hi, this is Ali ðŸ‘‹
 I am an experimental economics, working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bologna.

My research is focused on the topic of cooperation, specifically on reciprocity and conditional cooperation. A particular application of this literature that I am interested in is social production goods such as open-source software, wikis, public guides and so on.

For my research, I use methods from microeconomics, game theory, behavioral and experimental economics, agent-based modelling and social choice theory.

I am also interested in software development related to experimental social sciences and data analysis. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working [on several research projects](https://www.saral.it/#research)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Matter.js**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **behavioral experiments.**

## Some tools that I made or contributed
- **[zBrac](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/zbrac/)**: This is a tool for multilanguage experiments using the well-known behavioral experiment software [z-Tree](https://www.ztree.uzh.ch/en.html). We built it in with Python and Qt5, **together with Anna Schroeter**.
- **[choicepy](https://github.com/aseyq/choicepy)**: This is a social choce simulation (in an arrowian framework) tool for Python. It has very little features yet. We wanted to have a visually helpful tool that allows its users to investigate preference profiles as well. Made together with **Annika Hennes**. We also used it for our research paper "_Wisdom of crowds and voting_". 
- **[matchgreek](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/matchgreek/)**: A tool for LaTeX, that tells you which greek symbols you already used, and which are still available.
- **[flyCSV](https://github.com/aseyq/flyCSV)**: This is an R package (basially a wrapper) which allows you to take a look at your data frames as CSV files on the fly. 

## Some courses/documentations with public repositories
- **[oTree Community Book](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/otree-course)**: This is an open-documentation project that I am planning for the fantastic behavioral experiment software [oTree](https://github.com/oTree-org/oTree). At the moment repository contains my notes of the oTree course that I have given at the Max Planck Institute.
- **[Introduction to R for Mathematics](https://github.com/aseyq/trentomathr)**: This is the repository of the crash course I gave on R as a part of the mathematics course at the University of Trento. 
- **[Introduction to ggplot2](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/jdmx-ggplot2)**: This is the repository for 3 hours workshop on ggplot that I gave at the Judgment and Decision Making (JDMx) Workshop in 2019.

Some of my repos are on my previous account: [@seyhunsaral](https://www.github.com/seyhunsaral)



Here are some tools that I use (or enjoyed using in the past):
